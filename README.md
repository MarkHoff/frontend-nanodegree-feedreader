<h1>Project 6 - Testing Using Jasmine</h1>

<p>For this project, I updated the /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file to create the required tests to verify the functionality of a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

Before I could write any of the tests, however, I had to familiarize myself with the structure and processes included in the web app. To do this, I had to examine the index.html, style.css, and app.js files to really understand what the site was supposed to do and how the designer went about making that happen.</br>

The main purpose of the app is to call the Google Feed Reader API.  This is mainly accomplished in the loadFeed function of the app.js file.</br>

There are also some functions associated with the index.html and style.css files as well, such as the appearing/disappearing menu.</br>

The feedreader.js Jasmine file consists of four test suites:</p>

<li>
<ul>RSS Feeds</ul>
<ul>The Menu</ul>
<ul>Initial Entries</ul>
<ul>New Feed Selection</ul>
</li>
